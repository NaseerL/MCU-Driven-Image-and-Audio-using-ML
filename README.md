# MCU-Driven-Image-and-Audio-using-ML

Two projects are based on image and audion using Arduino Nano 33 BLE

Project 1 -> Object Detection
The camera on the microcontroller was utilized and trained to detect a spoon. When the camera was pointed towards a spoon, the output would indicate spoon detected

Project 2 -> Audio Detection
The camera on the microcontroller was utilized and trained to detect the word Pizza. When someone would speak into the microphone and the word "pizza" was used, the output would indicate that pizza is detected.
